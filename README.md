ChatGPTX is a lightweight application that allows you to quickly access a GPT window by pressing `Alt + Space`. This project uses a Progressive Web App (PWA) built on Microsoft Edge and AutoHotkey (AHK).

## Features

- Instantly opens a GPT window with `Alt + Space`.
- Automatic installer for AHK.
- Places the AHK script in the `shell:startup` folder for automatic startup.
- Installs the PWA with the correct name 'ChatGPTX' for easy recognition.

## Installation Instructions

2. Unzip the downloaded file.
